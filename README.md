# odin-recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project - a recipe website, where I showcase some of my favorite recipes I like to cook. 

My goal with this project is to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript and development tools such as VSCode, Git, GitHub and auxiliary skills like writing concise and consistent commit messages, etc. (also using newly installed Linux on my laptop which is very enjoyable, but also a standalone skill).
